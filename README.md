More about ESC-50 here: https://github.com/karolpiczak/ESC-50.


5 fold CV is performed. The segregation of 2000 audio files into folds is done as instructed by the dataset provider above. The spectograms for all 2000 images is generated by librosa then resnet 50 is trained on those spectograms. Accuracy achieved is 81.15% (you may not achieve the same number if you run it without any changes, but it will be between 80 and 82).
